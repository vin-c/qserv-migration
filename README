Description
-----------

Use this script to synchronize data between qserv hosts at CC-IN2P3 to an
Openstack infra.

HOWTO ?
-------

First, fire up an instance and get its uuid.
Fill in / copy / rename to the "credentials" file (sample provided)


./qserv-sync.sh prep 1xx
-> Will create a cinder volume at destination, connect it to the instance
-> Then, will partition and format to ext4 and finally mount it to /qserv

./qserv-sync.sh sync 1xx
-> Will check the mounted volume then connect to an SSH frontend
-> Then rsync the data from the qserv node (from 100 to 124) to the mounted volume

Other options as {attach|detach} will (un)mount and (dis)connect the specified volume

NOTES
-----

For now, this is only a hot sync without downtime but on running services (so with lock problems)
Later, this script may implement a cold sync stopping and restarting service on the fly.
